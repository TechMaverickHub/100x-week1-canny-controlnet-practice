# 100x Week 1 â€” Canny ControlNet Practice (ComfyUI)

Practice set for the 100x Cohort (Week 1): take a **single base image**, extract edges via **Canny ControlNet** to generate multiple stylistic variations in **ComfyUI**.  
This repo includes the workflow, inputs/outputs, and a simple experiment log to keep results reproducible.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Use a **base image** as ControlNet Canny guidance.
- Produce **diverse variations** (styles, compositions, palettes) while **preserving structure**.
- Track parameters for **repeatable results**.
