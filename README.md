# 100x Week 1 â€” Canny ControlNet Practice (ComfyUI)

Practice set for the 100x Cohort (Week 1): take a **single base image**, use **Canny ControlNet** to extract edges and generate multiple stylistic variations in **ComfyUI**.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Use a **base image** as ControlNet Canny guidance.  
- Produce **diverse variations** (styles, compositions, palettes) while **preserving outlines/structure**.  
- Track parameters for **repeatable results**.  

---

## ðŸ§­ What is Canny ControlNet?
**Canny ControlNet** uses the **edges/outlines** of the reference image as a structural guide while allowing the style and appearance to change.
